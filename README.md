# Minimal reproduction project

This is a bare Astro project. When I add React to it and create a small component with the `react-syntax-highlighter` library, it crashes on `astro build`.

Weird is, that in dev mode (`yarn dev`) it works fine.

## Steps to reproduce

1. run `yarn` to install packages
2. run `yarn build` - ends with error

## My error

```
